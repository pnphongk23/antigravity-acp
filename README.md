# Antigravity ACP Server

An [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (ACP) server for
Google Antigravity's `agy` CLI, built on [Bun](https://bun.com). It lets any
ACP-compatible editor drive `agy`: it spawns the CLI, streams its progress live,
and replays conversation history on demand.

## ⚠️ Terms of Service risk

Google's [Antigravity Terms of Service](https://antigravity.google/terms) state:

> You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the Service. This
> includes, but is not limited to, using the Service in connection with
> products not provided by us. Using third party software, tools, or services
> to access the Service (e.g. using OpenClaw with Antigravity OAuth) is a
> breach of this Agreement. Such actions may be grounds for suspension or
> termination of your account.

`antigravity-acp` does not itself request, store, or process any
authentication credentials — it only spawns the official `agy` binary as a
subprocess and talks to it over stdio; all Google OAuth login is handled
entirely by `agy` itself, outside of this project. However, the *effect* is
still a non-Google, ACP-compatible editor driving `agy` (and therefore your
Antigravity account) through a third-party tool — the exact pattern Google's
FAQ names as a Terms of Service violation (Claude Code, OpenClaw, OpenCode,
and by extension this project).

**By using `antigravity-acp` with an `agy` session logged into your personal
Antigravity account, you accept the risk that Google may suspend or terminate
that account.** This project is provided as-is, with no warranty, and its
authors and contributors accept no liability for any account action Google
takes as a result of its use. If you want to avoid this risk entirely, Google
recommends authenticating with a Vertex AI or AI Studio API key instead of an
Antigravity OAuth login.

See [#3](https://github.com/shubzkothekar/antigravity-acp/issues/3) for
background.

## Run

**From source (Bun required):**

```bash
bun run index.ts          # ACP over stdio
bun run index.ts --version
```

**As a compiled single-executable (no Bun required):**

```bash
dist/agy-acp-darwin-arm64   # macOS Apple Silicon
dist/agy-acp-darwin-x64     # macOS Intel
dist/agy-acp-linux-arm64    # Linux ARM64
dist/agy-acp-linux-x64      # Linux x86-64
dist/agy-acp-windows-arm64.exe # Windows ARM64
dist/agy-acp-windows-x64.exe   # Windows x86-64
```

Both modes speak ACP over stdio — point your editor at the binary as-is.

## agy auto-install

The server locates `agy` at startup using this priority order:

1. An `agy` binary placed next to the executable (`dist/agy`, or `bin/agy` when
   running from source after `bun install`).
2. `$AGY_BIN` — set this to point at your own build.
3. `agy` on `$PATH`.

If none are found the server downloads the matching release from GitHub
(`google-antigravity/antigravity-cli`) and verifies its SHA-256. The download is
skipped when `AGY_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` or `$AGY_BIN` is set.

`bun install` runs the same download via the `postinstall` hook, so a plain
`bun install` also provisions `agy` for source runs.

## Flags / env

| | |
|---|---|
| `AGY_BIN` | Path to an `agy` binary; skips the auto-download |
| `AGY_SKIP_DOWNLOAD` | Set to `1` to skip the download entirely |
| `AGY_EXTRA_ARGS` | Extra args forwarded to every `agy` invocation |
| `AGY_CONVERSATIONS_DIR` | Custom directory where `agy` writes its conversation SQLite databases |
| `AGY_MCP_CONFIG` | Override path to agy's `mcp_config.json` (default `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`) |
| `AGY_PERSISTENT` | Native stream-json sessions are enabled by default; set to `0` for one process per prompt |
| `AGY_PROMPT_TIMEOUT_MS` | Timeout for one streamed prompt turn in milliseconds (default: 300000) |

### Persistent sessions

With `agy` 1.1.15 or newer, each ACP session keeps one native
`--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json` process alive. Prompts
are sent as NDJSON user events, while the existing SQLite translator continues
to provide ACP updates. If stream-json startup fails, the adapter automatically
falls back to the original one-shot `agy -p` path.

## Build (Single Executable Application)

```bash
bun run build:mac-arm64    # → dist/agy-acp-darwin-arm64
bun run build:mac-x64      # → dist/agy-acp-darwin-x64
bun run build:linux-arm64  # → dist/agy-acp-linux-arm64
bun run build:linux-x64    # → dist/agy-acp-linux-x64
bun run build:win-arm64    # → dist/agy-acp-windows-arm64.exe
bun run build:win-x64      # → dist/agy-acp-windows-x64.exe
bun run build:all          # all six at once
```

The compiled binary embeds the entire TypeScript source and all dependencies. It
auto-downloads `agy` on first launch if not present next to the executable.

## ACP surface

- **initialize** — advertises `loadSession`, `additionalDirectories`,
  `list`/`delete`/`resume`/`close`, `embeddedContext`, and MCP HTTP/SSE.
- **session/new** — accepts `cwd`, `additionalDirectories`, and `mcpServers`;
  returns the session configuration options (including modes and available models).
  Client MCP servers are forwarded into agy's `mcp_config.json`. Paseo's internal
  per-agent MCP is routed through the caller-aware `paseo` CLI instead, avoiding
  cross-agent collisions in agy's global config.
- **session/set_config_option** — model and mode selection; persisted per session.
- **session/load** — replays full conversation history from the `agy` SQLite DB,
  including tool calls, task/permission/error decorators, and title updates.
- **session/resume** — re-attaches a client and re-sends `available_commands_update` and `config_option_update` notifications.
- **Post-session notifications** — after every `session/new`, `session/load`, and
  `session/resume` the server sends `available_commands_update` → `config_option_update` in order, so the UI can render the mode picker and model selector immediately.

### Shared streaming/replay engine

Live streaming and history replay differ only in how they treat the agent's
growing text stream. Everything else — tool calls, titles, user prompts, and the
task/permission/error enrichment — is identical, so both drive a single
[`Translator`](src/conversation/translator.ts):

- **stream** emits the newly-appended text slice each poll and dedups tool steps
  it has already sent;
- **replay** buffers consecutive agent-text parts and flushes them as one message
  at each boundary.

### Caching & performance

- **Incremental replay cache** ([replay.ts](src/conversation/replay.ts)): replays
  are cached per conversation and validated by file `(mtime, size)`. An unchanged
  conversation returns instantly; a conversation that merely grew has only its new
  tail of steps read and translated, then appended. (agy DBs are append-only.)
- **Reused DB handle**: the live poll loop keeps one `bun:sqlite` handle +
  prepared statement open for the whole turn instead of reopening each tick.
- **Bun-native throughout**: `bun:sqlite`, `Bun.spawn`, `Bun.stdin`/`Bun.stdout`,
  `Bun.file`/`Bun.write` — no `better-sqlite3`, `protobufjs` runtime, or
  node-stream shims.

## Test
